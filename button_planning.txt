I have:

- WINDOW MANAGER - list of all windows - Dict[hwnd, Tuple[Title, App_Name, Instance_Number]]

- APP INFO CACHE - saved info off all known programs. all apps from window manager are in there

- BUTTON INFO - has the basic instructions and properties of EACH button



Maybe

BUTTON INFO has the current state of all buttons.

during update thread a copy of it is updated

after thread it gets actually updated.

then the buttons get their info from it
