- style the second line on the button differently, like italics or something

- code hover-release functionality

- make window appear at cursor but beware of the edges

- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)


- maybe scrolling text in buttons

IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen
