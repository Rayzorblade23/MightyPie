- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- context menu for programs?

- disable for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

We could run PWAs like Youtube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name


BUGS:
- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

- positioning not exactly right

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"
