- projection switch on Function Pie Menu

- more efficient re-assignment when window closes

- only one instance?

- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- context menu for programs?

- make something special for explorer windows. maybe give them the second pie menu entirely

- disable for fullscreen applications?

- invert the button assignment process: give the button a method like accept windows from this program, accept windows from any program


IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen


BUGS:
- Special Menu doesn't hide every time when losing focus

- never getting a clean app quit in pycharm. might be irrelevant for external use

- simulated click to focus window is too low. open groups settings in Telegram

- positioning not exactly right

- sometimes focus-on-window makes the taskbar flash / throws an error but it still works

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"


BUGS in BUILD:

- restart doesn't work right
