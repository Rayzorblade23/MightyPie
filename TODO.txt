- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- context menu for programs?

- disable for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

We could run PWAs like Youtube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name


BUGS:
- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

- Restarting breaks some buttons on the first go. Completely crashes on the second go.

- when changing Fixed Slot to an occupied slot it won't kick the non-fixed app

- Special Menu doesn't hide every time when losing focus

- simulated click to focus window is too low. open groups settings in Telegram

- positioning not exactly right

- sometimes focus-on-window makes the taskbar flash / throws an error but it still works

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"


BUGS in BUILD:

- restart doesn't work right
