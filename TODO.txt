- find out why scrolling starts so late.


IDEA:
We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name

Collect multiple windows on one button


BUGS:
- after monitor change: menu open offset from cursor on primary screen

- one time: crash no "restore minimized"

- program doesn't refresh DPI when changing monitors (maybe not fixable)

- LaunchApp might not bring app to foreground

- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

BUGS in BUILD:

NUISANCE:
The App Info Cache informs what programs can be chosen for the Show Program Buttons.
But it accumulates all kinds of stuff you would never want to launch.
Maybe compare the .exes to something that says it's a more permanent thing?
