- restart Mighty Pie

- show InvisibleUI

- exclude from fullscreen applications?

- implement the sound settings from tabame in Special Menu

- make a window manager pie menu. up: max, down: min, restart window
- make the maximize button toggle between normal and maximized

- context menu for programs?

- make something special for explorer windows. maybe give them the second pie menu entirely


- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)

- disable for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen


BUGS:

- simulated click to focus window is too low. open groups settings in Telegram

- positioning not exactly right

- sometimes focus-on-window makes the taskbar flash / throws an error but it still works

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"
