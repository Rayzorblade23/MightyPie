- fix desktop shouldn't be able to be minimized

- put in more logging to text file. maybe only in window functions

- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- context menu for programs?

- disable for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

We could run PWAs like Youtube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name


BUGS:
- first mouse click in Button Config doesn't do anything except closing Special Menu

- minimizing when no valid window is there does strange things

- maximize/minimize sometimes works on wrong window

- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

- positioning not exactly right

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"
