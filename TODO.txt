- put in more logging to text file. maybe only in window functions

- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- clear for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

Implement a Delay when opening that can be set via config.
There is already a setOpacity with singleShot in show_pie_menu_at_mouse_pos

We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name

Collect multiple windows on one button


BUGS:

- one time: crash no "restore minimized"

- program doesn't refresh DPI when changing monitors (maybe not fixable)

- LaunchApp might not bring app to foreground

- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

BUGS in BUILD:


WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY:
Pie Menu are always shown with their parent, the window spanning transparent Pie Window
This is because mouse events are not registered outside PyQt windows
It's possible though as now implemented in Special Menu.
This would have saved a lot of trouble, but it works fine as is.
