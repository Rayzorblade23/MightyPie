- add Icon to button

- in the PieButton, what happens when it gets updated? Does the ScrollingTextLabel need Update functions?

- have CHatGPT implement type hinting for functions

- use PID to differentiate two explorer windows with the same name


- code hover-release functionality

- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)


- maybe scrolling text in buttons

IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen
