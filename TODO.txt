- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)


- close window on right-click


IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen


BUGS:
- positioning not exactly right

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- bug in getting windows to distribute to both pie manager pages

- Text 2 is cut off a bit, probably not regarding italics
