- make window span the whole screen and open pie_menu at cursor

- code hover-release functionality

- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)

IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen


BUGS:
- positioning not exactly right

- when opening a jump from the last position is visible

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)
