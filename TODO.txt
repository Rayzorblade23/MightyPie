- what's up with crash log?

IDEA:
We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.


NUISANCE:
The App Info Cache informs what programs can be chosen for the Show Program Buttons.
But it accumulates all kinds of stuff you would never want to launch that isn't filtered out.
Maybe compare the .exes to something that says it's a more permanent program?
