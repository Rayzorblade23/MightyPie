- put in more logging to text file. maybe only in window functions

- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- clear for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

Implement a Delay when opening that can be set via config.
There is already a setOpacity with singleShot in show_pie_menu_at_mouse_pos

We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name

Collect multiple windows on one button


BUGS:

- one time: crash no "restore minimized"

- program doesn't refresh DPI when changing monitors (maybe not fixable)

- LaunchApp might not bring app to foreground

- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

BUGS in BUILD:
