IDEA:
We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.


BUGS:
- LaunchApp might not bring app to foreground



BUGS in BUILD:

NUISANCE:
The App Info Cache informs what programs can be chosen for the Show Program Buttons.
But it accumulates all kinds of stuff you would never want to launch.
Maybe compare the .exes to something that says it's a more permanent thing?
