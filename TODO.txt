- implement the sound settings from tabame in Special Menu

- make a window manager pie menu. up: max, down: min, restart window


- save previous condition of minimized windows (i. e.: maximized or normal)


IDEA:
Remove Windows button but open when clicking bottom left of screen


BUGS:
- positioning not exactly right

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"
