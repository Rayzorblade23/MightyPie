- need to make sure that the menu can't be opened while buttons are being replaced.

- put in more logging to text file. maybe only in window functions

- window control pie menu: implement restart window

- clear for fullscreen applications?


IDEA:

Implement a Delay when opening that can be set via config.
There is already a setOpacity with singleShot in show_pie_menu_at_mouse_pos

Implement Task Types as Buttons inherited from Pie Button instead

We could run PWAs like YouTube Music via custom run commands. Would need a new type of pie menu button.

Also: reverse buttons via Window Name, instead of App Name

Collect multiple windows on one button


BUGS:
- LaunchApp might not bring app to foreground

- Scrolling not working on Labels of Window Control Pie Menus

- first mouse click in Button Config doesn't do anything except closing Special Menu

- maximize/minimize sometimes works on wrong window

- MightyPie sometimes starts with smaller Pie Menus

- positioning not exactly right

- Spotify text is cut off when title changes (maybe fixed?!)

- window gets an instance increase when a number is included in the title the same way...? as in " (i)"
